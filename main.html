        Continuous Tone Coded Squelch System (CTCSS) or Digital Coded Squelch (DCS), aka Digital Private Line (DPL), is a means of sharing common radio channels. 
        The concept of this efficient use of radio space is that a "subaudible" tone is transmitted along with the FM voice signal. It uses frequencies from 60-250Hz to encode a
        unique tone for each group. "Although we call these frequencies subaudible they are within the hearing range of most people. Voice communication systems are designed to use the frequency range of 300 Hz to 3 kHz, which allows for normal speech to be understood. As long as we filter out the frequencies below 300 Hz before the signal gets to the radio speaker, the user won’t notice the presence of the CTCSS tone, but we’ll still have the desired voice frequencies."
        Given the tone is always transmitted with the voice signal, the group can tune out all other groups' transmissions by setting their squelch to open only when the receiver detects their specific tone.
        <br>
        Remember that the CTCSS signal has already been frequency modulated. Once you demodulate the signal, you will find the 60-250Hz frequencies contain the tone and the higher frequencies contain the voice.

        <li> Write a program to display the group code whenever one is transmitted.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1> Notes </h1>
        I was messing around with the Radio Reference in the Augusta area, and I noticed the "AirMed Dispatch" <a href="https://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/?ctid=503#cid-5059"> around 154MHz </a>.
        In the tone column, it was shown that it was using DPL. The transmissions on this frequency were not constant, but if I listened long enough, I would be able to see transmissions lasting ~10 seconds.
        I recall just hearing the digital tone and no voice, but it would be interesting to write a program to display the code every time one is transmitted.

        Squelch: effectively a power level threshold to filter out noise. If you set your squelch too low, you hear static. Too high, you could filter out some signal.

        22OCT2020: Made some observations on how often the signal appears and for how long. Used GQRX for visualization and only roughly logged the second that the 
        signal showed up/disappeared. The first value indicates the time elapsed since the end of the previous signal and the second value indicates how long the signal
        roughly lasted. Overall, no transmissions more than 50 seconds or less than 10 seconds. No gaps less than 1 minute or greater than 5 minutes.
        Noise floor is ~-66dBFS, signal is roughly -46dBFS. LNA was 31.2dB.
        <ul>
			<li> 1251:50 -- start observing 154.213MHz </li>
			<li> 1252:26 -> 1252:45 -- first signal, 19 seconds</li>
			<li> 1257:38 -> 1257:51 -- ~5 min, 13 seconds</li>
			<li> 1300:30 -> 1301:11 -- ~2.5min, 41 seconds</li>
			<li> 1302:28 -> 1303:08 -- ~1min, 40 seconds</li>
			<li> 1306:07 -> 1306:20 -- ~3min, 13 seconds</li>
			<li> 1309:45 -> 1310:10 -- ~3min, 25 seconds</li>
			<li> 1310:33 -- stop observing 154.213MHz</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        Don't know if I just got unlucky, but I ended up seeing the signal in my GRC program after I increased the RF gain from 0dB to 35dB. Unlike GQRX, the floor here is more like -80dB and
        the actual signal looked closer to -60dB. Didn't get actual values, just saw the signal. Going to try and create a flowgraph to save the signal once it appears.
